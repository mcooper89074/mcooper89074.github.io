    <p>
      I am a web developer who works on desktop and mobile web applications.
      I am just starting to learn web development using tutorials on the
      Mozilla Developer Network web site. I want to learn as much as I can
      and then get a job doing web development as soon as  I can. I am also
      interested in back end programming as well.
    </p>
    <p>I work with 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      and more to create solutions for the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before my career in web development, I worked as an experimental physicist and science teacher.
      I enjoyed both of these endeavors but I am now seeking to apply my experience and abilities
      in the private sector.
